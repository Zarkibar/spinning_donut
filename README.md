# Spinning Donut
It's just a fun side project where I use my graphics programming knowledge to replicate the famous spinning donut project. Maybe I'll add some more objects later and probably a camera movement in the future. A mini game someday? (who knows).

## ðŸš€ Features

- ASCII torus (or Pygame graphics for now)
- Rotating in 3D
