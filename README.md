# Spinning Donut
It's just a fun side project where I use my graphics programming knowledge to replicate the famous spinning donut project.
It has some other objects too like a cube or a custom obj object. I updated this project into a game engine in which I will try to make a simple game with these core concepts.

The program has a fairly basic movement and mouse control for now.

WASD - for movement
UP,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT - for mouse

## Features

- ASCII torus (or Pygame graphics for now)
- Rotating in 3D
- Customizable geometry

## Demo

## Known Bugs

 - Movement isn't reative to the mouse rotation. It's global for now
 - Vertical mouse rotation is broken

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

How to get it up and running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zarkibar/spinning_donut.git
cd spinning_donut
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Plans for future
 - Removing pygame and integrating just a terminal for visuals
 - Light illumination
